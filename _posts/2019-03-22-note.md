I am currently experiencing problems related to the Jekyll layout this site uses. The sidebar links are not directing properly because GitHub Pages no longer supports relative permalinks, which this site uses. I will work on a way to turn these relative permalinks into absolute permalinks, but in the meantime, here is a temporary site navigation:

[About](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/about)
[Context](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/context)
[Maps](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/maps)
[Memes](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/memes)
[Rhetoric](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/rhetoric)
[Sources](https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/sources)

The home, download, and GitHub project links still work. Additionally, all pages can be found by typing https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/NAME--so to view the rhetoric tab, you would type https://isawil.github.io/russian-ads/rhetoric. 

I apologize for the inconvenience, and am working on a solution.
