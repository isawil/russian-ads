Here are some maps!

## How to read

Reading these maps requires some additional knowledge of how Facebook targets ads--something that the site has come under criticism for. Facebook has faced criticism for allowing users to [target advertisements to "Jew-haters,"](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-enabled-advertisers-to-reach-jew-haters) and for allowing housing advertisers to [exclude Black and Asian users from target audiences](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-advertising-discrimination-housing-race-sex-national-origin).

Facebook continues to allow advertisers to curate their audiences. The ads collected in this dataset target Facebook users who have liked certain pages, who Facebook thinks have certain interests, and who live in or visit certain places. Below are a few maps I created. They show the places the Internet Research Agency targeted during this time period. I hope you'll pay attention to the differences between "location" and "residence."

"Location" and "residence" mean specific things. "Location" refers to the place you currently are, as seen by Facebook using [technology]. "Residence," on the other hand, means the place you call home, also according to Facebook. If you have a Facebook account and have indicated where you currently live, that's it. As an example, my Facebook profile says I live in Los Angeles, California, but I am currently typing this text from a hotel in Portland, Oregon. LA is my residence, while Portland is my location.

From these two maps, we see the span of ads that are targeted to specific locations or residences.
