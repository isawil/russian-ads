This is a digital humanities project centered around Facebook advertisements purchased by the Internet Research Agency, a Russian "troll farm." In this project, I seek to visualize data in a few different ways: geographically, graphically, and chronologically. 

My name is Isaac Williams. I'm a graduate student at UCLA, where I study library and information science. I created this project for Miriam Posner's Digital Humanities 201 class. You can learn more about me (here)[https://isawil.github.io].
