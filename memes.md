### Memes

Many people who use the internet regularly are familiar with memes. Memes are oft-beloved jokes that circulate throughout the internet. The word also refers to image macros themselves--which you've probably seen on Facebook, if nowhere else. 

There's a darker side to memes, though. Before the 2016 presidential election, presidential candidate Hillary Clinton publicized the years-old meme Pepe the Frog. [Clinton described it](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12926976/hillary-clinton-trump-pepe-the-frog-alt-right-explainer) as a previously harmless meme that had since been adopted by white supremacists. 

As a part of internet culture, it's expected to see them throughout social media. And it's true: memes are shared by people who come from all walks of life, all over the internet. Leftists share memes about guillotining the rich while users from the far right share memes targeting women, people of color, and LGBT people. 

What I noticed was that the ads purchased by the Internet Research Agency used some of the same techniques as the so-called "alt-right" in their disinformation campaign. Many of the ads invoked images of internet culture, including memes (both the funny kind, and image macros), references to vlogs and other forms of new media, and specifically targeting themselves at people interested in 9GAG, Reddit, and Imgur. 

The word "meme" means a lot of different things depending on who you ask. To simplify things, I'll borrow Data & Society's definitions of the word.

Of the first definition, Data & Society writes that:

> An internet meme is “a piece of culture, typically a joke, which gains influence 
> through online transmission.” Limor Shifman defines a meme as “cultural
> information that passes along from person to person, yet gradually scales into a
> shared social phenomenon.” While virtually anything can be a meme since it’s a
> unit of information, in modern internet parlance, a meme is a visual trope that 
> proliferates across internet spaces as it is replicated and altered by anonymous users. 

Some examples of memes include...

To talk about memes, we first need to understand that the term can be used in a variety of ways. The first can best be understood as a joke, image, or subject that is repeated throughout the internet in a variety of ways. Some examples of memes that you might be familiar with are “you know I had to do it to em,” “Doge,” or “Rick rolling.” Memes are posted and exchanged throughout the internet, and across the political spectrum. Leftists share memes about guillotining the rich; members of the far right share anti-semitic memes. Memes like “Doge” are mainstream enough to cross political lines, and are shared on most (sanitized) versions of social media sites. 

Another definition of memes encompasses any kind of image macro. Some of these will be familiar to anyone who uses the internet on a regular basis. A lot of these memes are simply pictures with large impact font on the top and bottom.

Irony is a common feature of memes. In milder versions of ironic memes, the traditional impact font meme is turned on its head. Younger or more immersed internet users are oftentimes derisive towards this meme style, and turn the formal elements of the meme into their own meme. [examples of ironic memes aimed at ironizing the impact font/style] One example is the “bottom text” meme, which parodies the meme generation site MemeGenerator. Here’s an example: https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/141/506/c05.jpg

However, irony extends into less innocent arenas. “Ironic” discrimination is relatively common in memes appearing in conservative circles of the net. [find images of “ironic” memes]

In the wake of the recent Christchurch shootings, Twitter user @???? shared the tweet: “there’s no such thing as ironic racism” in reaction to the defense of “ironically” racist memes shared by members of the far right. As Data & Society points out: “milder images are intended to work as “gateway drugs” to the more extreme elements of alt-right ideology” (37). 

Returning to the ads themselves, many of the ads feature memes in the form of image macros. The memes aren’t cutting edge, and don’t spend much time trying to be funny. Instead, they focus on ideology. 

Many of these ads also use the language of internet conservatism. One ad uses the word “libtard,” a portmanteau of (you guessed it) “liberal” and “retard”: https://mith.umd.edu/irads/files/original/3c8d22c35adb8662f2c5a47e49ed0a9b.png

One references vlogs (video blogs), the centerpiece of YouTube: https://mith.umd.edu/irads/files/original/ea77ebd41bbb6010e746080cd0fad163.png
